1) Finish SQLite setup and rebuild codebase to utilise it.
2) Separate the role portions of the bot into a separate Pycord Cog.
3) Set up bot to get speedrun.com data and related Discord commands.
4) Set up bot to fetch twitch clips. Probably a good idea to learn how pagination works.
5) Set up bot to get iron bros challenge data.
6) Set up Flask webservice to deal with interaction endpoints, TOS, and Privacy Policy.
